These are interfaces between an application and a feature that is abstracted into a &#8220;library&#8221; &#8211; a service provided by the platform's operating system.</dd><dt>API&nbsp;Layer</dt><dd>A complex Internet application might require a large number of APIs, such as, for example, one for every network layer. In practice it is more common to have a single API that encompasses all network layers below it, with the component providing that API likely invoking other APIs itself. which in turn invoke other APIs. For example, a web application might use a library that presents a single API to all of the HTTP network stack from HTTP all the way down to IP. Note that there need not be a direct correspondence of network and API layers.</dd><dt>Authentication</dt><dd>The process of establishing the veracity or origin of some statement (e.g., of an entity's identity), usually by proxy (e.g., with key-pairs to an asymmetric key cryptographic system &#8220;speaking for&#8221; the authenticated entities). In this document, and unless otherwise stated, &#8220;authentication&#8221; will refer to authentication of identity of entities such as &#8220;users&#8221;, &#8220;hosts&#8221;, and &#8220;services&#8221;.</dd><dt>Authentication&nbsp;Mechanism</dt><dd>A cryptographic protocol for authenticating entity identities. Note that this does not cover POSTing usernames and passwords in forms, but it does cover bearer token mechanisms (if just barely).</dd><dt>Authentication&nbsp;Method</dt><dd>A scheme for authenticating entity identities. An authentication method can be non-cryptographic, covering HTTP Basic authentication and usernames&amp;passwords POSTed from HTML forms.</dd><dt>Authentication&nbsp;Framework</dt><dd>A protocol into which other authentication mechanisms may be plugged in. For example: SASL<a href="#RFC4422"><cite title="Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)">[RFC4422]</cite></a>, GSS-API<a href="#RFC2743"><cite title="Generic Security Service Application Program Interface Version 2, Update 1">[RFC2743]</cite></a>, EAP<a href="#RFC3748"><cite title="Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)">[RFC3748]</cite></a>, among others.</dd><dt>Bearer&nbsp;Token</dt><dd>A technique for authentication that involves a message that can be presented by the authenticating entity to another. No proof of possession is required for using bearer tokens, which means that the token can be presented by any entity possessing the token, which in turn means that bearer tokens must be sent with confidentiality protection, as otherwise eavesdroppers can steal them and use them to impersonate the subject.</dd><dt>Channel&nbsp;Binding</dt><dd>A security protocol composition and analysis tool. The purpose of channel binding<a href="#RFC5056"><cite title="On the Use of Channel Bindings to Secure Channels">[RFC5056]</cite></a> is to &#8220;bind&#8221; a secure channel (at one layer in the network stack) into an authentication protocol running at a higher layer in the stack, thereby ensuring that the channel is end-to-end and &#8220;speaks for&#8221; its end-points.</dd><dt>Confidentiality&nbsp;protection</dt><dd>Cryptographic encryption of data. Confidentiality protection is/must always be used with integrity protection as well.</dd><dt>Data&nbsp;authentication</dt><dd>Data origin authentication, a.k.a., integrity protection.</dd><dt>Hardware&nbsp;Security&nbsp;Module&nbsp;(HSM)</dt><dd>A hardware component of security-critical trusted third parties. An HSM is intended to be reasonably secure against physical and software attacks against it -much more than traditional servers-, thus making it ideal for storing non-extractable secret/private key material.</dd><dt>Integrity&nbsp;protection</dt><dd>Cryptographic protection against modification of data. See also &#8220;data authentication&#8221;, above.</dd><dt>Mechanism</dt><dd>Shorthand for &#8220;authentication mechanism&#8221;, a protocol defining messages to be exchanged in order to authenticate one party to another (or two parties to each other).</dd><dt>Mutual&nbsp;Authentication</dt><dd>Authentication of a user and a server/service to each other.</dd><dt>Mutual&nbsp;Authentication&nbsp;(key&nbsp;confirmation&nbsp;sense)</dt><dd>In some protocols key exchange is bound to authentication of the service to the user such that the service is finally authenticated when it sends a proof-of-possession of the exchanged session key back to the user. Protocols that use RSA key transport (e.g., TLS in common usage), Diffie-Hellman with a persistent public key for the server, or Needham-Schroeder protocols (such as Kerberos<a href="#RFC4120"><cite title="The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)">[RFC4120]</cite></a>), perform server authentication in this way. A client may not always care to receive key confirmation. For example, a Kerberos client for a lossy logging application might not care that confidentiality protected data ends up at the wrong server, as long as unintended servers can't decrypt the data. Some clients may send application data optimistically ahead of key confirmation from the server. Such data should generally be confidentiality protected, and the protocol should not be subject to MITM attacks where the MITM can somehow modify what optimistic data is sent, nor should an active attacker be able to replay such optimistic data.</dd><dt>Network&nbsp;Layer</dt><dd>A layer in the OSI or Internet network model. Examples of layers that are relevant to HTTP applications: IP, TCP/UDP, TLS, HTTP, and the application layer.</dd><dt>Proof&nbsp;of&nbsp;Possession</dt><dd>A technique for authentication that involves using a cryptographic operation to &#8220;prove&#8221; (not necessarily in a rigorous sense) that the entity that creates the proof has access to a private/secret key to a cryptosystem (e.g., a private RSA key, a secret AES key, etcetera).</dd><dt>Public&nbsp;Key&nbsp;Infrastructure&nbsp;(PKI)</dt><dd>An authentication system based on public key cryptography and supporting hierarchical transitive trust via trusted third parties known as Certificate Authorities (CAs).</dd><dt>Relying&nbsp;Party</dt><dd>An entity that authenticates another. For example, in PKI the entity that validates another's certificate as part of the process of authenticating that other entity, is a relying party.</dd><dt>SCRAM</dt><dd>Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM)<a href="#RFC5802"><cite title="Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM) SASL and GSS-API Mechanisms">[RFC5802]</cite></a>, a SASL<a href="#RFC4422"><cite title="Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)">[RFC4422]</cite></a> and GSS mechanism based on password-derived pre-shared keys and challenge/response. SCRAM is intended as the successor to SASL's DIGEST-MD5, and possibly to HTTP's DIGEST-MD5.</dd><dt>Server</dt><dd>A system with one or more IP addresses, serving HTTP on one more TCP ports on those IP addresses. [A general definition would not be constrained to HTTP only, but for the purposes of this document this is good enough.]</dd><dt>Service</dt><dd>An entity providing a service or services for an application. Typically -but not always!- a service is closely related to a host server, which may provide several services. Usually we need to distinguish between the various services that a single host provides, thus we often need to authenticate the <em>service</em> rather than the host server. For HTTP applications a service may be a collection of resources available on one (or more) ports on a given server.</dd><dt>Trust&nbsp;(in&nbsp;authentication)</dt><dd>This word, &#8220;trust&#8221;, is a terrible word: it means too many things to too many people. But it's also a very convenient word when everyone understands the meaning to be accorded to it in any given context. For the time being this document will use this word, &#8220;trust&#8221;, as follows: to trust an entity is to accept as fact assertions -relating to other entities- made by the trusted entity. Alternative phrasing: to trust an entity is to rely on it to make assertions relating to other entities the truth of which cannot otherwise be ascertained. For example, in a PKI a relying party relies on the certification authorities (and related infrastructure) to make statements of facts of the form &#8220;the public key &lt;key&gt; belongs to &lt;subject name&gt;&#8221; (details elided). We only use &#8220;trust&#8221; in connection to &#8220;trusted third parties&#8221; &#8211; when an authenticated entity makes assertions about itself we do not speak of trusting them to do so.</dd><dt>Trust&nbsp;(in&nbsp;user&nbsp;interfaces)</dt><dd>One of the many alternative meanings of &#8220;trust&#8221;, and the only alternative one used in this document, relates to user interfaces, namely: a trusted user interface is one that the user can somehow ascertain that it is presented by the operating system or browser platform and <em>not</em> by some possibly malicious peer.</dd><dt>Trust&nbsp;Path</dt><dd>Continuing with the horrible word &#8220;trust&#8221;, we use &#8220;trust path&#8221; to the note the list of trusted third parties involved in authenticating an entity to a relying party. This list is ordered, though it could conceivably be set of lists when multiple trust paths are possible.</dd><dt>Trusted&nbsp;Third&nbsp;Party</dt><dd>An entity that can be relied up -by those relying parties that trust it- to make assertions relating to other entities, typically assertions about how to authenticate those entities and/or of facts relevant to authorization at the relying party.</dd></dl><p id="rfc.section.1.3.p.3"> <span class="comment">[rfc.comment.1:

Bad guys use any number of phishing techniques such that the names of their services need not even match those of the services that they wish to steal credentials for. The goal should be to keep the bad guys out altogether, but this is also quite difficult, if not impossible for many reasons including political ones.</p><p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">The TLS server PKI suffers from a number of other non-fundamental problems, mostly due to legacy deployment:</p><p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.3"> </p><ul><li>x.500-style naming, which utterly fails to match Internet naming (domainnames, e-mail addresses, etcetera); <ul><li>The addition of subjectAlternativeName (SAN) does not successfully address this problem because a) the TBSCertificate's primary Name is still limited to being an x.500 name, and b) too much of the deployed relying party base simply lacks SAN support.</li></ul> </li><li>incomplete implementations of the PKIX standards; <ul><li>For example, missing implementations of name constraints, leading to the inability of CAs to safely issue intermediate CA certificates to their customers as either such certificates cannot contain critical name constraints or those are ignored by some relying parties anyways, thus intermediate CAs have no real constraints other than those enforceable by HSMs.</li><li>In general it is not possible to make use of critical certificate extensions in certificates that will be presented to the Internet web's user-agents: they will either ignore such extensions, fail soft (by prompting the user as to whether to continue or fail), or fail hard. None of these relying party behaviors are desirable on the Internet. This problem arises from the nature of security protocols that use PKIs, which in turn results from the off-line infrastructure nature of PKIs. By encouraging non-negotiation of security features, PKI pushes future extensions into a critical/non-critical dichotomy, but since critical extensions are difficult to deploy, the result must either be additional negotiation in protocols using PKI (e.g., TLS SNI), or non-use of critical extensions. Compare to Kerberos, where there is a negotiation between the client and the server <em>by proxy</em> (i.e., mediated by the KDC).</li></ul> </li></ul><p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.4">The TLS server PKI also suffers from all the problems that trusted third party systems suffer from, namely: the need to trust the third parties. Fortunately there are a number of efforts under way to improve the trustworthiness of TLS server PKI CAs by, for example, making them auditable by the public [XXX Add references to CT, Convergence, HSTS/TACK/other pinning schemes, and others!]</p><p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.5">And yet the TLS server PKI is here to stay. It will not go away. We can only minimize the dependence of the web's security on the TLS server PKI. To do so requires authentication mechanisms that can provide authentication of the server to the user in some manner such that none of the above problems apply. The hardest PKI problem to address is the fundamental problem described above: this requires accepting a smaller scale of server/service authentication to the user &#8211; a balkanization of sorts of the web, but see the discussion of trust islands in <a href="#sub_Trust_Establishment" title="Trust Establishment">Section&nbsp;3.6</a>.</p><h2 id="rfc.section.2.4"><a href="#rfc.section.2.4">2.4</a>&nbsp;<a id="d1e719" href="#d1e719">On Mutual Authentication and URI Schemes</a></h2><p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.1"> <span class="comment">[rfc.comment.5:

If the client knows a priori to authenticate and the URL contains sensitive information then the client has no choice but to leak this information prior to completing mutual authentication, thus the client becomes dependent on TLS for authenticating the server even when the client could authenticate the server more strongly via the selected HTTP authentication mechanism. This is an important weakness.</li><li>The whole sequence involves multiple requests/responses, which goes against the stateless nature of HTTP. State is needed in all three examples, but the first example is RESTful, while the second employs a would-be new verb that provides for stateful authentication. The third example simply cannot be thought of as remotely RESTful. Perhaps this is not a problem. <ul><li>Alternatively mechanisms requiring multiple round trips can be ruled out of scope.

The APIs offered by an HTTP stack should look remarkably similar regardless of which layer the user authentication protocol is technically at. Once again, the difference between HTTP-layer and standard application-layer user authentication is minimal.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.3.2.p.2">Note however that if the HTTP stack does not implement authentication, leaving it to the application to do so, then the application developer runs the risk of making mistakes in the implementation, such as failing to implement channel binding where possible. Thus it is generally best if the HTTP stack implements authentication &#8211; even if TLS is used for user authentication, the HTTP stack should provide a singular API for authentication.</p><h3 id="rfc.section.3.3.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3.3.3">3.3.3</a>&nbsp;<a id="d1e1026" href="#d1e1026">Choice of Layer</a></h3><p id="rfc.section.3.3.3.p.1">The choice of layer is clearly more important for APIs than on the wire.

And since the application will generally decide that authentication is required only after (possibly well after) a TLS connection is setup, the user generally must be authenticated by renegotiating TLS, which in turn means that two round trips will be needed just for that, at minimum, even if the user authentication mechanism selected requires fewer round trips. This is inefficient, though not fatal.</li><li>The TLS community has resisted proposals for user authentication mechanisms with arbitrary round trip counts before [references? this is in reference to Stefan's TLS-GSS proposal...]. This may no longer be true (or perhaps the author is misunderstanding or misremembering the events in question), but if it is still the case then the range of choices for user authentication in TLS is significantly curtailed.</li><li>Several major TLS implementations defer certificate validation until the peer's Finished message is received. This means that unless one is using TLS renegotiation (with the inner connection's server certificate being the same as in the outer connection's) the user's identity and the payloads related to user authentication will be revealed to the server before the server is authenticated.</li><li>User Interface issues: <ul><li>A user authentication framework and future mechanisms will likely need to interact with the user. In some cases this may be best done through a platform component, such as a credential management facility. In other cases this may best be done by the application.

XXX Add references for OCSP, AAA, ...]</span> </p><p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.2">&#8220;Infrastructure&#8221; consists, for the purposes of this document, of services such as Identity Providers (IdPs), Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and their servers, Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders, Kerberos Key Distribution Centers (KDCs), RADIUS/DIAMETER servers, etcetera. These are services that run on parties other than a client (e.g., a web browser / user agent) and an application server. In some cases infrastructure services may be physically co-located with the client or server, but by and large they are physically separated; infrastructure services are always logically separate from the client and server. [XXX Move this to glossary.]</p><p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.3">Some protocols require that the client do all or most of the message exchanges with infrastructure, some require that the server do this messaging, some require both to do some messaging. In some cases a server might proxy a client's messages to infrastructure. There are advantages to the client doing this messaging: namely a simpler server, less subject to denial of service / resource consumption attacks. [Are there advantages to the server doing this messaging?]</p><p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.4">Consider a protocol like Kerberos. Kerberos relies on Key Distribution Center (KDC) infrastructure, and it relies on the client doing all the messaging needed to ultimately authenticate it to a server. Kerberos can be used in a way such that the relying party proxies this messaging for the client (see IAKERB), but even so the client had to communicate with the KDCs in order to ultimately authenticate to the relying party &#8211; IAKERB is simply a proxy mechanism.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.5">Now consider an authentication mechanism based on PKI. The only online infrastructure in a PKI are the CRLs and OCSP responders. Of course, a Certificate Authority (CA) can also be online, as in kca [add reference], a CA that authenticates clients via Kerberos and which issues fresh, short-lived certificates. Private keys for certificates can also be served by online services such as SACRED and browserid. The method of validating certificates currently considered ideal is for the possessor of certificate's private key to send both, the certificate and a current/fresh OCSP response for it (or, rather, responses, for the entire certificate chain), thus the PKI relying party should ideally not have to contact infrastructure; in practice CRL checking is still the more commonly used method, requiring infrastructure messaging on the relying party side.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.6">The responsibility for infrastructure messaging varies widely.</p><h2 id="rfc.section.3.5"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5">3.5</a>&nbsp;<a id="d1e1121" href="#d1e1121">Number of Messages</a></h2><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.1">The number of messages that must be exchanged in order to authenticate a peer varies a lot by authentication mechanism. Some require just one message from the client to the server. Others require a reply message from the server. Others require some larger number of messages (typically three or four). Yet others require a variable number of messages.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.2">Typically key exchange is also required in order to provide confidentiality and integrity protection to the transport. Key exchange protocols also vary in number of messages required. Key exchange and authentication may be combined, either directly in a single network layer, or across layers via channel binding.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.3">One-message authentication protocols:</p><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.4"> </p><ul><li>OAuth</li><li>Kerberos (w/o key confirmation)</li><li>Public key signature schemes when authenticating only the client</li><li>Diffie-Hellman (when the client knows the server's DH public key a priori, and w/o key confirmation)</li><li>RSA key transport (w/o key confirmation)</li><li>all bearer token protocols (but see [ref to on channel bindings section])</li></ul><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.5">Two-message authentication protocols:</p><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.6"> </p><ul><li>Kerberos</li><li>Diffie-Hellman with fixed public keys</li><li>RSA key transport</li></ul><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.7">Authentication protocols with three or more messages, or with arbitrary numbers of messages:</p><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.8"> </p><ul><li>Most/all zero-knowledge password proof protocols (e.g., SRP) (usually three or four messages)</li><li>SCRAM, and other challenge-response protocols (usually three or four messages)</li><li>IAKERB (usually four messages)</li><li>Pluggable frameworks (SASL, GSS, EAP) (arbitrary message counts, usually dependent on what mechanism is selected)</li></ul><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.9">It's worth pointing out that TLS is a three- to four-message protocol, but when providing confidentiality protection for the client identity it becomes a six- to eight-message protocol (though there is a proposal to improve this, getting back to three to four messages [add reference to Marsh's I-D]).</p><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.10">Some authentication protocols can provide key exchange, others cannot. Similarly, not all mechanisms can provide channel binding.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.11">The total number of messages required is important. These message exchanges are always ordered and synchronous; no progress can be made by the application until they are completed. Over long distances the time to complete each round trip add up to noticeable latency, and there is much pressure to get this latency down to an absolute minimum.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.12">Integrating user authentication into TLS has the clear allure of potentially cutting down the number of round trips necessary, but it's not clear that this can be achieved in every case. In particular it may not be clear that a client has to authenticate until after a TLS connection is established over which the client may request access to some resource that requires authenticated clients.</p><h2 id="rfc.section.3.6"><a href="#rfc.section.3.6">3.6</a>&nbsp;<a id="sub_Trust_Establishment" href="#sub_Trust_Establishment">Trust Establishment</a></h2><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.1">Pair-wise pre-shared keying systems require careful initial key exchange, but otherwise have no transitive trust issues: every pair of entities that has shared keying can communicate without the aid of any other entity. However, pair-wise pre-shared keying does not scale to the Internet as it is O(n^2), and it requires either &#8220;leap of faith&#8221; (a.k.a., trust on first use, or TOFU) or physical proximity for the key pre-sharing. Physical proximity</p><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.2">Authentication mechanisms that scale to the Internet of necessity require some degree of trust transitivity. That is, there must be many cases where Alice and Bob can communicate with each other only because they can authenticate each other by way of one or more third parties (e.g., Trent) that each of them trust a priori.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.3">There are a number of issues with trust transitivity:</p><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.4"> </p><ul><li>Trusted third parties can mount MITM attacks on the parties that rely on them <ul><li>Compromise of trusted third parties, therefore, has far reaching, negative effects</li><li>The longer a trust path, the less trustworthy -so to speak- it is</li></ul> </li><li>Policy for determining acceptable trust paths is difficult to express</li><li>Mechanisms for establishing trust paths are often manual and prone to error or abuse</li></ul><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.5">There are several ways to use transitive trust. In hierarchical transitive trust we organize the trusted third parties in such a way that there should be a trust path for every pair of entities of interest (e.g., every user to every server, every user to every user, ...) &#8211; think of PKI. In mesh systems trust transits through every entity's &#8220;friends&#8221; &#8211; think of PGP.</p><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.6">There may be other models of transitive trust, such as one with islands of trust. An islands of trust model would consist of federations of transitive trust (using hierarchical or mesh models) that are much smaller than the entire Internet, but large enough to be of use to large numbers of users. For example, an online merchant might provide for authentication of all users to a set of participating vendors [XXX expand on this].</p><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.7">Given the need for transitive trust and the serious drawbacks of transitive trust, some workarounds may be necessary, such as:</p><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.8"> </p><ul><li>Policy language for choosing suitable trust paths</li><li>Facilities for limiting the length of, or otherwise shortening trust paths <ul><li>By, for example, providing for bootstrapping of shorter trust paths when a given trust path involves an &#8220;introducer&#8221; trusted third party.</li></ul> </li><li>&#8220;Pinning&#8221; facilities to force changes in the infrastructure to proceed in ways which make some MITM attacks harder to mount</li><li>Auditing -and compromise detection- facilities by which to show that trusted third parties are not mounting MITM attacks</li><li>Revocation facilities that actually work</li><li>Root keys that are rarely used and live in HSMs</li><li>Fast re-keying as a method for dealing with trusted third party compromise</li></ul><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.9">For an example of pinning, consider a TLS extension where self-signed, persistent user certificates are used, possibly one per-origin for pseudonymity purposes. The user agent can enroll the user certificates at their corresponding origin servers such that thereafter no MITMs are possible that can impersonate the user to the server. Of course, such a scheme suffers from needing a fall-back authentication method when the user's device(s) that store the relevant private keys are lost. Users would need to be able to fall-back on an alternative authentication method for re-enrollment, likely one that is susceptible to attack or else is inconvenient. In this cases the pinning is on the server side; keep in mind that pinning need not only be used on clients, but may be used even in the distributed trust infrastructure (e.g., to shorten trust paths).</p><p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.10">Ideally an authentication facility for HTTP/2.0 should support a variety of trust establishment models, as it is not clear that one mode is superior to the others. (Though certainly the hierarchical model is likely the scheme that can have the most universal reach, and therefore most minimize user credentials needed. However, users may not mind having a small number of logon credentials for a trust island model.)</p><h2 id="rfc.section.3.7"><a href="#rfc.section.3.7">3.7</a>&nbsp;<a id="d1e1275" href="#d1e1275">Threat Modeling</a></h2><p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.1"> <span class="comment">[rfc.comment.12:

Each user would be able to register with the bank federation that is relevant to them, and either obtain an ID within that federation, or to register an external ID for use in authenticating to banks in this federation. (Users could have more than one identify, of course.) Because such a federation would so exclusive for service membership it would be much more difficult for phishers to target its members &#8211; in order to target them the phisher would have to either become a member of the highly exclusive federation (which can be made much more difficult than merely joining the TLS server PKI) or subvert the user-agent UIs.

Shopping as such shopping federations where the entity running the federation allows relatively few member services (orders of magnitude fewer than on the global Internet, in the TLS server PKI). In effect we already have this, but we have no strong way to bind this into the user authentication experience. If these federations provided a user authentication mechanism that provides mutual authentication and channel binding to TLS then the weaknesses of the TLS server PKI would become completely irrelevant to the federations, their members, and their users.</p><h1 class="np" id="rfc.references"><a href="#rfc.section.6" id="rfc.section.6">6.</a> References</h1><table summary="References"><tr><td class="reference"><b id="RFC2119">[RFC2119]</b></td><td class="top"><a href="mailto:sob@harvard.edu" title="Harvard University">Bradner, S.</a>, &#8220;<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels</a>&#8221;, BCP&nbsp;14, RFC&nbsp;2119, March&nbsp;1997.</td></tr><tr><td class="reference"><b id="RFC5246">[RFC5246]</b></td><td class="top">Dierks, T. and E.
