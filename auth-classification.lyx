\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The HTTPbis WG is accepting proposals for new authentication systems for
 HTTPbis, the successor to Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) version 1.1
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"

\end_inset

.
 This document proposes a classification system for these proposals.
 Several axes of classification are proposed, and several simplified imagined
 or likely authentication systems are used to illustrate the classification
 system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author assumes that the WG is interested primarily in new user authenticatio
n proposals, with ones that provide mutual authentication (of users and
 servers to each other) being in scope.
 The author also assumes that Transport Layer Security (TLS) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-2"

\end_inset

 will continue to be used by HTTPbis for cryptographic session protection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some familiarity with authentication systems is assumed.
 A glossary is provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conventions used in this document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
 "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are
 to be interpreted as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "key-1"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document considers user authentication only in the context of HTTP
 applications, whether they be web applications or otherwise.
 Authentication of the service is also in scope, but authentication methods
 that authenticate only the user to the service (with the service authenticated
 by Transport Layer Security (TLS)) are in scope.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are at least two entities involved in authentication in this context:
 the user (on the client side), one or more of the web server host or the
 web server application/service, and any trusted third parties that an authentic
ation mechanism might involve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Description
API Application Programming Interface.
 These are interfaces between an application and a feature that is abstracted
 into a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

library
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- a service provided by the platform's operating system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
API
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Layer A complex Internet application might require a large number of APIs,
 such as, for example, one for every network layer.
 In practice it is more common to have a single API that encompasses all
 network layers below it, with the component providing that API likely invoking
 other APIs itself.
 which in turn invoke other APIs.
 For example, a web application might use a library that presents a single
 API to all of the HTTP network stack from HTTP all the way down to IP.
 Note that there need not be a direct correspondence of network and API
 layers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Authentication The process of establishing the veracity or origin of some
 statement (e.g., of an entity's identity), usually by proxy (e.g., with key-pairs
 to an asymmetric key cryptographic system

speaking for
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the authenticated entities).
 In this document, and unless otherwise stated, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 will refer to authentication of identity of entities such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Framework A protocol into which other authentication mechanisms may be plugged
 in.
 For example: SASL

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-13"

\end_inset

, EAP
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-12"

\end_inset

, among others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Bearer
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Token A technique for authentication that involves a message that can be
 presented by the authenticating entity to another.
 No proof of possession is required for using bearer tokens, which means
 that the token can be presented by any entity possessing the token, which
 in turn means that bearer tokens must be sent with confidentiality protection,
 as otherwise eavesdroppers can steal them and use them to impersonate the
 subject.

(HSM) A hardware component of security-critical trusted third parties.
 An HSM is intended to be reasonably secure against physical and software
 attacks against it -much more than traditional servers-, thus making it
 ideal for storing non-extractable secret/private key material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

Authentication
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(key

confirmation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sense) In some protocols key exchange is bound to authentication of the
 service to the user such that the service is finally authenticated when
 it sends a proof-of-possession of the exchanged session key back to the
 user.
 Protocols that use RSA key transport (e.g., TLS in common usage), Diffie-Hellman
 with a persistent public key for the server, or Needham-Schroeder protocols
 (such as Kerberos
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-5"

\end_inset

), perform server authentication in this way.
 A client may not always care to receive key confirmation.
 For example, a Kerberos client for a lossy logging application might not
 care that confidentiality protected data ends up at the wrong server, as
 long as unintended servers can't decrypt the data.
 Some clients may send application data optimistically ahead of key confirmation
 from the server.
 Such data should generally be confidentiality protected, and the protocol
 should not be subject to MITM attacks where the MITM can somehow modify
 what optimistic data is sent, nor should an active attacker be able to
 replay such optimistic data.

\begin_layout Description
Network

 Examples of layers that are relevant to HTTP applications: IP, TCP/UDP,
 TLS, HTTP, and the application layer.

 hierarchical transitive trust via trusted third parties known as Certificate
 Authorities (CAs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Relying
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Party An entity that authenticates another.
 For example, in PKI the entity that validates another's certificate as
 part of the process of authenticating that other entity, is a relying party.

SCRAM Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, a SASL
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and GSS mechanism based on password-derived pre-shared keys and challenge/respo
nse.
 SCRAM is intended as the successor to SASL's DIGEST-MD5, and possibly to
 HTTP's DIGEST-MD5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Server A system with one or more IP addresses, serving HTTP on one more
 TCP ports on those IP addresses.
 [A general definition would not be constrained to HTTP only, but for the
 purposes of this document this is good enough.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Service An entity providing a service or services for an application.
 Typically -but not always!- a service is closely related to a host server,
 which may provide several services.
 Usually we need to distinguish between the various services that a single
 host provides, thus we often need to authenticate the 
\emph on
service
\emph default
 rather than the host server.
 For HTTP applications a service may be a collection of resources available
 on one (or more) ports on a given server.

(in

authentication) This word, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trust
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is a terrible word: it means too many things to too many people.
 But it's also a very convenient word when everyone understands the meaning
 to be accorded to it in any given context.
 For the time being this document will use this word, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trust
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as follows: to trust an entity is to accept as fact assertions -relating
 to other entities- made by the trusted entity.
 Alternative phrasing: to trust an entity is to rely on it to make assertions
 relating to other entities the truth of which cannot otherwise be ascertained.
 For example, in a PKI a relying party relies on the certification authorities
 (and related infrastructure) to make statements of facts of the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the public key <key> belongs to <subject name>
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (details elided).

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Web applications today use a variety of user authentication methods, many
 of which are somewhat or deeply unsatisfying.
 Almost all of these methods involve the user-agent being mostly dumb --
 not participating in any cryptographic protocols other than TLS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most common user authentication methods used in web applications today
 include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Username and password POSTed to the server from an HTML form.
 Usually the URL to post to is an HTTPS URL.
 Not as often the URL of the HTML page containing the form is also an HTTPS
 URL.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HTTP Basic or DIGEST-MD5 authentication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Out-of-band methods:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
PINs sent to user devices via SMS (POSTed along with passwords)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OTP tokens (POSTed along with passwords)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
login URLs e-mailed to the user
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
passwords e-mailed to the user
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Not much use is made of TLS user certificates, though that is available
 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These methods are somewhat-to-highly unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Users have to remember/carry too many passwords, even when they have many
 fewer 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

identities
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (typically in the form of e-mail addresses).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Credential sharing becomes a problem: compromise of one site can result
 in compromise of user accounts at unrelated sites.
 Also, a malicious site posing as a friendly site can do the same.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The service is generally not authenticated to the user.
 TLS does authenticate the server, but not necessarily the service, and
 anyways only to the best of the TLS server PKI's ability.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This problem derives in part from the nature of the HTTP URI scheme: by
 identifying server hosts rather than services the HTTP URI scheme fails
 to provide the user and user-agent with enough information by which to
 identify, and thence authenticate, a service.
 New URI schemes may be required.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The TLS server PKI is fundamentally weak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User credentials are too easy to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

phish
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OTP and out-of-band methods do not protect against MITMs, and thus depend
 on the integrity of TLS and the TLS server PKI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HTTP/Negotiate
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which effectively uses GSS-API
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 mechanisms, usually NTLM [XXX Add reference] or Kerberos
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-5,key-15"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, there is no strong concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sessions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in web applications.
 Sessions, such as they are, consist of HTTP requests and responses united
 into a session by the web cookies they bear.
 Not all web cookies are used for identifying sessions, and there is no
 simple 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

logout
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 functionality.
 The biggest problem with web cookies is that they are too easy to misuse
 or steal (e.g., given the occasional TLS vulnerability, such as BEAST [XXX
 Add references!]).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, there are uncomfortable user interface (UI) problems.
 In particular it is difficult to convey to the user information about the
 server's/service's identity and how it is authenticated (if at all).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
HTTP applications that are not web application have similar issues, though
 some of them can also use SASL
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"

\end_inset

.
 Non-web HTTP applications also may not need cookies, instead using a single
 HTTP/1.1 persistent connection over which to issue all requests that make
 up a session -- such applications have a stronger sense of session than
 web applications do.

, such as transitivity, introductions, and so on.
 This is important for evaluating proposals.
 A proposal that replaces the TLS server PKI's primacy with...
 another system with similar transitive trust issues may not be a useful
 proposal.
 On the other hand, it seems impossible to avoid transitive trust when scaling
 to Internet scale.
 Understanding this may help, for example, give impetus to improvements
 to the TLS server PKI, or it may guide replacements, understand scalability,
 and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
On the TLS Server PKI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TLS server PKI, and, truly, any hierarchical or flat PKI intended for
 authenticating servers or services to users has a fundamental problem:
 the number of Names for which to issue certificates is too large to expect
 the PKI administrators to do a good job of keeping out the bad guys.
 Bad guys use any number of phishing techniques such that the names of their
 services need not even match those of the services that they wish to steal
 credentials for.
 The goal should be to keep the bad guys out altogether, but this is also
 quite difficult, if not impossible for many reasons including political
 ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TLS server PKI suffers from a number of other non-fundamental problems,
 mostly due to legacy deployment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
x.500-style naming, which utterly fails to match Internet naming (domainnames,
 e-mail addresses, etcetera);
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The addition of subjectAlternativeName (SAN) does not successfully address
 this problem because a) the TBSCertificate's primary Name is still limited
 to being an x.500 name, and b) too much of the deployed relying party base
 simply lacks SAN support.
\end_layout

For example, missing implementations of name constraints, leading to the
 inability of CAs to safely issue intermediate CA certificates to their
 customers as either such certificates cannot contain critical name constraints
 or those are ignored by some relying parties anyways, thus intermediate
 CAs have no real constraints other than those enforceable by HSMs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In general it is not possible to make use of critical certificate extensions
 in certificates that will be presented to the Internet web's user-agents:
 they will either ignore such extensions, fail soft (by prompting the user
 as to whether to continue or fail), or fail hard.
 None of these relying party behaviors are desirable on the Internet.
 This problem arises from the nature of security protocols that use PKIs,
 which in turn results from the off-line infrastructure nature of PKIs.
 By encouraging non-negotiation of security features, PKI pushes future
 extensions into a critical/non-critical dichotomy, but since critical extension
s are difficult to deploy, the result must either be additional negotiation
 in protocols using PKI (e.g., TLS SNI), or non-use of critical extensions.
 Compare to Kerberos, where there is a negotiation between the client and
 the server 
\emph on
by proxy
\emph default
 (i.e., mediated by the KDC).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The TLS server PKI also suffers from all the problems that trusted third
 party systems suffer from, namely: the need to trust the third parties.
 Fortunately there are a number of efforts under way to improve the trustworthin
ess of TLS server PKI CAs by, for example, making them auditable by the
 public [XXX Add references to CT, Convergence, HSTS/TACK/other pinning
 schemes, and others!]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And yet the TLS server PKI is here to stay.
 It will not go away.
 We can only minimize the dependence of the web's security on the TLS server
 PKI.
 To do so requires authentication mechanisms that can provide authentication
 of the server to the user in some manner such that none of the above problems
 apply.
 The hardest PKI problem to address is the fundamental problem described
 above: this requires accepting a smaller scale of server/service authentication
 to the user -- a balkanization of sorts of the web, but see the discussion
 of trust islands in

 the server (in addition to the client) and key confirmation.
 Describe the limitations, imposed by the HTTP URI scheme, on service identifica

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
On Authentication Mechanism Message Counts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All authentication mechanism require some number of messages in order to
 authenticate an entity.
 For example, TLS generally requires two round-trips, while OAuth requires
 a single message from the client to the server.
 Here we count only messages from the HTTP client to the HTTP server; additional
 message exchanges may be required involving trusted third parties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of authentication messages that must be exchanged for a given
 authentication mechanism is important.
 The API of at least one important credential management facility is premised
 on authentication mechanisms having exchanges of just one message -- adding
 new API is possible, but it would take a long time for applications to
 begin using it.
 Thus mechanisms that require just one message are at a premium (but see
 the next section).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of authentication messages is also important for latency reasons:
 since authentication message exchanges are synchronous, each round trip
 time is added to the latency observed by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of messages that an authentication mechanism needs to exchange
 with infrastructure (e.g., trusted third parties) also affects latency, but
 at least applications need never be aware of messages exchanged with infrastruc
ture -- these can be abstracted away by the APIs.
 Some authentication mechanisms have fast re-authentication facilities such
 that the latency cost of infrastructure messaging need not be incurred
 as frequently as the entity authenticates to others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout RevisionRemark
...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
On One-Message Authentication Mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Half round trip mechanisms depend utterly on some other system for authenticatio
n of the server -- in webauth this means the TLS server PKI.
 To understand why imagine that an application sends the one authentication
 message to a service, but it turns out that it is speaking to an impersonator
 for that service.
 The impersonator can at the very least obtain any sensitive data that the
 application is willing to send immediately.
 Additionally, if there's no channel bindings between the authentication
 mechanism and the service impersonator then the one message can be sent
 by the impersonator to the real service, letting the service impersonator
 impersonate the user to the real service as well (thus being a proper MITM).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There exist a number of one-message webauth authentication mechanisms that
 are widely deployed; we cannot forbid their use, we can only document their
 security considerations, namely: that they depend entirely on the TLS server
 PKI for their security.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Solutions based on bearer tokens vs.
 ones based on proof of possession;

\end_layout

\begin_layout RevisionRemark
Maybe add something about separation of password verifier access, to limit
 the attack surface area for password recovery?
\end_layout

\begin_layout RevisionRemark
Note: The author assumes that all acceptable proposals will have HTTPbis
 continue to depend on TLS for transport security -- for confidentiality
 (encryption) and integrity (authentication) protection of data exchanged
 by the HTTPbis client and server.
 If this assumption is incorrect then we can add one more axis of classification
: dependence on / independence of TLS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These nine classification axes are largely orthogonal to each other.
 Other classification criteria are also possible and may be added in future
 versions of this Internet-Draft.
 Some such possible additional criteria are subjective, such as, for example:
 ease of deployment, ease of implementation, etcetera.
 Perhaps the WG can come to consensus regarding desirable properties based
 on objective classification to narrow the set of proposals to consider.
 Or perhaps the WG can consider a large number of proposals and use objective
 classification to guide any applicability statements for the proposals
 accepted.
 Ideally the WG can apply objective classification first, then for each
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bucket
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of similar proposals the WG could consider more subjective classification
 criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dependence on TLS Server PKI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The web today depends utterly on the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

TLS server PKI
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for security.
 This would be just fine were it not for the systemic weaknesses in the
 TLS server PKI: the lack of name constraints, the large number of trust
 anchors, the large number of certificate authority (CA) compromises, and
 so on.
 Building on the TLS server PKI and thus assuming its being sufficiently
 secure, is quite tempting, as it may simplify various aspects of user authentic
ation (not least by providing server authentication a priori, thus saving
 the designers the need to provide server authentication themselves).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This classification axis is very simple: either a proposed solution depends
 on the TLS server PKI or it doesn't.
 Some shades of black are imaginable in this case (if not likely).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bearer Tokens vs.
 Proof of Possession
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A bearer token is a message the presentation of which is sufficient to authentic
ate the presenter.
 Stolen bearer tokens may be used to trivially impersonate the subject,
 thus bearer tokens generally require confidentiality protection in any
 protocols over which they might be exchanged, and generally depend on authentic
ating the relying party first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proof of possession systems consist of some secret/private key(s), an authentica
tor message the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proves
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 possession of the secret or private key(s) used in the construction of
 the authenticator, and a token not unlike a bearer token but which securely
 indicates to the relying party(ies) what keys the user must have used in
 the construction of the authenticator.
 The relying party then validates the authenticator to establish that the
 user did indeed possess the necessary secret/private key(s) to the best
 of the cryptographic capabilities of the authentication system used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Layer at which Authentication Protocol Operates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to design user (and mutual) authentication mechanisms that
 can work at any end-to-end layer between the HTTPbis client and server.
 The relevant layers are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TLS,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HTTPbis,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and the application layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We dismiss out of hand the possibility of that layer being TCP or IPsec,
 though admittedly they are also end-to-end layers where user authentication
 could theoretically be done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We distinguish between network layers and API layers (see glossary).
 A solution at the application 
\emph on
network
\emph default
 layer might nonetheless be implemented at the HTTP 
\emph on
API
\emph default
 layer (and vice-versa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
User authentication is generally something that a transport layer cannot
 know to initiate on its own: the application must be in control of when
 (server- and client-side) to authenticate, how (server- and/or client-side),
 with what credentials / as whom (client-side).
 This means that authentication in the transport layer requires APIs that
 give the application a measure of control.
 HTTP API capabilities will vary, but HTTPbis is a good opportunity to standardi
ze an abstract API outlining capabilities and semantics to be exposed to
 applications by an HTTP stack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that on the user-agent side the platform may provide user interaction
 facilities for authentication, thus simplifying user authentication APIs.
 The application, on the server side, remains in control over when to initiate
 authentication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
End-to-end session cryptographic protection is best done in the lowest possible
 transport layer.
 For HTTP applications, historically this means TLS; though it'd be technically
 feasible to provide protection at lower layers it does not appear to be
 a realistic option at this time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
User authentication is best 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bound
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into transport security layers, in this case TLS.
 When user authentication is moved to higher layers a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

channel binding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 problem arises: we would like to ensure that no man-in-the-middle exists
 in the transport layer, with the MITM terminating two TLS connections.
 For more information about channel binding see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UI and API issues are quite different for web applications versus non-web
 applications.
 The former have rich UI elements (all of HTML's) and programming models
 (scripting, particularly through JavaScript).
 One problem that is particularly severe for web applications, is the ability
 of server impersonators to emulate all imaginable graphical user interfaces
 that the native user-agent might wish to use to distinguish itself from
 the applications it runs.
 Regardless of what layer implements authentication this problem will arise
 in web applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
HTTP- vs.
 Application-Layer Authentication in the Network Stack
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's important to note that there need not be much difference between HTTP-layer
 and application-layer user authentication, at least if we assume a standard
 application-layer user authentication convention.
 For argument's sake let's assume an application-layer user authentication
 convention like the one in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-6"

\end_inset

, and let's assume two possible HTTPbis HTTP-layer authentication solutions:
 one that is most similar to HTTP/1.1's and one that uses a new verb for
 authentication.
 Then let's look at what each of these three solutions look like on the
 wire using the SCRAM mechanism for cases where the client already knows
 it has to authenticate.
 For brevity we elide any HTTP request and response where the server indicates
 that the client must authenticate, as well as any requests/responses involving
 negotiation of mechanism to use.

\begin_layout Standard
There's not much difference between the first two examples.
 The third example has several important differences relative to the first
 two examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The URL is sent to the server before any chance to have completed mutual
 authentication, should the selected mechanism provide mutual authentication.
 If the client knows a priori to authenticate and the URL contains sensitive
 information then the client has no choice but to leak this information
 prior to completing mutual authentication, thus the client becomes dependent
 on TLS for authenticating the server even when the client could authenticate
 the server more strongly via the selected HTTP authentication mechanism.
 This is an important weakness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The whole sequence involves multiple requests/responses, which goes against
 the stateless nature of HTTP.
 State is needed in all three examples, but the first example is RESTful,
 while the second employs a would-be new verb that provides for stateful
 authentication.
 The third example simply cannot be thought of as remotely RESTful.
 Perhaps this is not a problem.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Alternatively mechanisms requiring multiple round trips can be ruled out
 of scope.
 This would rule out quite a few desirable mechanisms!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The main difference on the wire between a generic HTTP-layer user authentication
 framework (like the one in the second example) and an application-layer
 equivalent (as in the first example) can be so minimal as to make the choice
 of layer seem like splitting hairs.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
HTTP- vs.
 Application-Layer Authentication in the API Stack
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are HTTP stacks that make it possible to implement HTTP authentication
 methods in the application (e.g., FCGI in web servers), and nothing would
 prevent HTTP stacks from implementing a 
\emph on
standard
\emph default
 application-layer user authentication protocol either.
 The APIs offered by an HTTP stack should look remarkably similar regardless
 of which layer the user authentication protocol is technically at.
 Once again, the difference between HTTP-layer and standard application-layer
 user authentication is minimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note however that if the HTTP stack does not implement authentication, leaving
 it to the application to do so, then the application developer runs the
 risk of making mistakes in the implementation, such as failing to implement
 channel binding where possible.
 Thus it is generally best if the HTTP stack implements authentication --
 even if TLS is used for user authentication, the HTTP stack should provide
 a singular API for authentication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Choice of Layer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of layer is clearly more important for APIs than on the wire.
 On the wire the choice of layer is minimal, trivial even, when the choice
 is between HTTP and the application layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the WG agrees that the distinction between HTTP-layer and application-layer
 user authentication is or should be minimal then how should the WG pick
 one of those two layers, if it decides not to pursue TLS-layer user authenticat
ion?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A standard application-layer authentication scheme implies no changes to
 HTTP itself, and may not rely on any particular features of HTTP/1.1 or
 HTTPbis, thus it may be usable even with HTTP/1.0.
 This is true of the REST-GSS proposal
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which is also RESTful.
 This must be of some value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An HTTP-layer authentication solution must either: a) not support multi-round
 trip mechanisms, b) add verbs, or c) not be RESTful.
 (a) works with HTTP/1.0, (b) would not work with HTTP/1.0.
 [The author believes that RESTfulness is desirable.]

\begin_layout Subsubsection
User Authentication in the TLS Layer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Issues:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The transport cannot know when to require user authentication (on the server
 side) or when to initiate it (on the client side).
 Simply always initiating user authentication creates privacy problems:
 the user may not want to disclose their identity all the time!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To address the problem of when to require or initiate user authentication
 the TLS implementation must provide suitable APIs to the application.
 And since the application will generally decide that authentication is
 required only after (possibly well after) a TLS connection is setup, the
 user generally must be authenticated by renegotiating TLS, which in turn
 means that two round trips will be needed just for that, at minimum, even
 if the user authentication mechanism selected requires fewer round trips.
 This is inefficient, though not fatal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The TLS community has resisted proposals for user authentication mechanisms
 with arbitrary round trip counts before [references? this is in reference
 to Stefan's TLS-GSS proposal...].
 This may no longer be true (or perhaps the author is misunderstanding or
 misremembering the events in question), but if it is still the case then
 the range of choices for user authentication in TLS is significantly curtailed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Several major TLS implementations defer certificate validation until the
 peer's Finished message is received.
 This means that unless one is using TLS renegotiation (with the inner connectio
n's server certificate being the same as in the outer connection's) the
 user's identity and the payloads related to user authentication will be
 revealed to the server before the server is authenticated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User Interface issues:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A user authentication framework and future mechanisms will likely need to
 interact with the user.
 In some cases this may be best done through a platform component, such
 as a credential management facility.
 In other cases this may best be done by the application.
 Driving user interaction from within the TLS layer presents a slight complicati
on: any interaction has to be effected through application- or platform-provided
 code paths.
 Adding interaction to existing TLS implementations may not be trivial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
...
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Benefits:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Where the platform can provide credential management and user interaction
 then user authentication in TLS can greatly simplify HTTP applications:
 no user authentication APIs or UIs are then needed in the application.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Note however that the user may have a hard time identifying the context
 in which they are being prompted by the system for credentials or credential
 selection.
 This is usually not a problem in smart-phone and other such small devices,
 where it is generally clear what application is in the foreground, and
 therefore the context of a prompt.
 But this is not necessarily so on other platforms.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Non-web applications typically know a priori when they wish to authenticate.
 Typical non-web applications that use HTTP/1.1 over a single TLS connection,
 with an application session consisting of all the HTTP requests performed
 over that one connection.
 For such applications having user authentication in the TLS layer may be
 the simplest way to get user authentication into the application.

Party Responsible for Infrastructure Messaging

\begin_layout RevisionRemark
XXX Add references for OCSP, AAA, ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Infrastructure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 consists, for the purposes of this document, of services such as Identity
 Providers (IdPs), Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and their servers,
 Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders, Kerberos Key Distribution
 Centers (KDCs), RADIUS/DIAMETER servers, etcetera.
 These are services that run on parties other than a client (e.g., a web browser
 / user agent) and an application server.
 In some cases infrastructure services may be physically co-located with
 the client or server, but by and large they are physically separated; infrastru
cture services are always logically separate from the client and server.
 [XXX Move this to glossary.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some protocols require that the client do all or most of the message exchanges
 with infrastructure, some require that the server do this messaging, some
 require both to do some messaging.
 In some cases a server might proxy a client's messages to infrastructure.
 There are advantages to the client doing this messaging: namely a simpler
 server, less subject to denial of service / resource consumption attacks.
 [Are there advantages to the server doing this messaging?]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a protocol like Kerberos.
 Kerberos relies on Key Distribution Center (KDC) infrastructure, and it
 relies on the client doing all the messaging needed to ultimately authenticate
 it to a server.
 Kerberos can be used in a way such that the relying party proxies this
 messaging for the client (see IAKERB), but even so the client had to communicat
e with the KDCs in order to ultimately authenticate to the relying party
 -- IAKERB is simply a proxy mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider an authentication mechanism based on PKI.
 The only online infrastructure in a PKI are the CRLs and OCSP responders.
 Of course, a Certificate Authority (CA) can also be online, as in kca [add
 reference], a CA that authenticates clients via Kerberos and which issues
 fresh, short-lived certificates.
 Private keys for certificates can also be served by online services such
 as SACRED and browserid.
 The method of validating certificates currently considered ideal is for
 the possessor of certificate's private key to send both, the certificate
 and a current/fresh OCSP response for it (or, rather, responses, for the
 entire certificate chain), thus the PKI relying party should ideally not
 have to contact infrastructure; in practice CRL checking is still the more
 commonly used method, requiring infrastructure messaging on the relying
 party side.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The responsibility for infrastructure messaging varies widely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Number of Messages
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of messages that must be exchanged in order to authenticate a
 peer varies a lot by authentication mechanism.
 Some require just one message from the client to the server.
 Others require a reply message from the server.
 Others require some larger number of messages (typically three or four).
 Yet others require a variable number of messages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically key exchange is also required in order to provide confidentiality
 and integrity protection to the transport.
 Key exchange protocols also vary in number of messages required.
 Key exchange and authentication may be combined, either directly in a single
 network layer, or across layers via channel binding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One-message authentication protocols:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
OAuth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Kerberos (w/o key confirmation)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Public key signature schemes when authenticating only the client
\end_layout

 and w/o key confirmation)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Kerberos
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Diffie-Hellman with fixed public keys
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
RSA key transport
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Authentication protocols with three or more messages, or with arbitrary
 numbers of messages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most/all zero-knowledge password proof protocols (e.g., SRP) (usually three
 or four messages)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SCRAM, and other challenge-response protocols (usually three or four messages)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
IAKERB (usually four messages)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pluggable frameworks (SASL, GSS, EAP) (arbitrary message counts, usually
 dependent on what mechanism is selected)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's worth pointing out that TLS is a three- to four-message protocol, but
 when providing confidentiality protection for the client identity it becomes
 a six- to eight-message protocol (though there is a proposal to improve
 this, getting back to three to four messages [add reference to Marsh's
 I-D]).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some authentication protocols can provide key exchange, others cannot.
 Similarly, not all mechanisms can provide channel binding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total number of messages required is important.
 These message exchanges are always ordered and synchronous; no progress
 can be made by the application until they are completed.
 Over long distances the time to complete each round trip add up to noticeable
 latency, and there is much pressure to get this latency down to an absolute
 minimum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Integrating user authentication into TLS has the clear allure of potentially
 cutting down the number of round trips necessary, but it's not clear that
 this can be achieved in every case.
 In particular it may not be clear that a client has to authenticate until
 after a TLS connection is established over which the client may request
 access to some resource that requires authenticated clients.

Trust Establishment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pair-wise pre-shared keying systems require careful initial key exchange,
 but otherwise have no transitive trust issues: every pair of entities that
 has shared keying can communicate without the aid of any other entity.
 However, pair-wise pre-shared keying does not scale to the Internet as
 it is O(n^2), and it requires either

 (a.k.a., trust on first use, or TOFU) or physical proximity for the key pre-sharin
g.
 Physical proximity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Authentication mechanisms that scale to the Internet of necessity require
 some degree of trust transitivity.
 That is, there must be many cases where Alice and Bob can communicate with
 each other only because they can authenticate each other by way of one
 or more third parties (e.g., Trent) that each of them trust a priori.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of issues with trust transitivity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Trusted third parties can mount MITM attacks on the parties that rely on
 them
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Compromise of trusted third parties, therefore, has far reaching, negative
 effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The longer a trust path, the less trustworthy -so to speak- it is
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Policy for determining acceptable trust paths is difficult to express
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mechanisms for establishing trust paths are often manual and prone to error
 or abuse
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several ways to use transitive trust.
 In hierarchical transitive trust we organize the trusted third parties
 in such a way that there should be a trust path for every pair of entities
 of interest (e.g., every user to every server, every user to every user,
 ...) -- think of PKI.
 In mesh systems trust transits through every entity's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

friends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- think of PGP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There may be other models of transitive trust, such as one with islands
 of trust.
 An islands of trust model would consist of federations of transitive trust
 (using hierarchical or mesh models) that are much smaller than the entire
 Internet, but large enough to be of use to large numbers of users.
 For example, an online merchant might provide for authentication of all
 users to a set of participating vendors [XXX expand on this].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the need for transitive trust and the serious drawbacks of transitive
 trust, some workarounds may be necessary, such as:

\begin_layout Itemize
Fast re-keying as a method for dealing with trusted third party compromise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an example of pinning, consider a TLS extension where self-signed, persisten
t user certificates are used, possibly one per-origin for pseudonymity purposes.
 The user agent can enroll the user certificates at their corresponding
 origin servers such that thereafter no MITMs are possible that can impersonate
 the user to the server.
 Of course, such a scheme suffers from needing a fall-back authentication
 method when the user's device(s) that store the relevant private keys are
 lost.
 Users would need to be able to fall-back on an alternative authentication
 method for re-enrollment, likely one that is susceptible to attack or else
 is inconvenient.
 In this cases the pinning is on the server side; keep in mind that pinning
 need not only be used on clients, but may be used even in the distributed
 trust infrastructure (e.g., to shorten trust paths).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally an authentication facility for HTTP/2.0 should support a variety
 of trust establishment models, as it is not clear that one mode is superior
 to the others.
 (Though certainly the hierarchical model is likely the scheme that can
 have the most universal reach, and therefore most minimize user credentials
 needed.
 However, users may not mind having a small number of logon credentials
 for a trust island model.)

\begin_layout Standard
It seems likely that no single user authentication method will satisfy the
 needs of all web applications.
 Nor can we predict the future.
 Moreover, some weak authentication approaches are perfectly safe for accessing
 low-value resources, or in contexts where the Internet threat model is
 overkill.
 This argues for a multitude of solutions, and possibly a pluggable system.
\end_layout

For all authentication mechanisms (i.e., cryptographic authentication methods)
 use the GSS-API, possibly through the thin shim of SASL/GS2

 the name of the service to authenticate to.
 This will allow login pages to have a customized look, yet allow for login
 operations to be performed by the browser platform using a strong authenticatio

 Specifically there must be a method for kick-starting authentication such
 that the user and/or device identity and credential input does not happen
 through HTML forms but through browser/platform trusted user interfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Specify a new URI scheme that identifies services rather than hosts.
 For example: svc:<service>@<domainname>/<local-part>.
 An option to embed service authentication information (possibly a digital

\begin_layout Subsection
Trust Islands for Effective Mutual Authentication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author's vision for mutual authentication for high-value services (e.g.,
 shopping, banking) is to use small federations of like services to mutually
 authenticate all of their many users to the member services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, suppose there were a federation of banks in a single country
 (or currency zone), allowing only members that are chartered as banks with
 the relevant bank chartering authorities.
 Each user would be able to register with the bank federation that is relevant
 to them, and either obtain an ID within that federation, or to register
 an external ID for use in authenticating to banks in this federation.
 (Users could have more than one identify, of course.) Because such a federation
 would so exclusive for service membership it would be much more difficult
 for phishers to target its members -- in order to target them the phisher
 would have to either become a member of the highly exclusive federation
 (which can be made much more difficult than merely joining the TLS server
 PKI) or subvert the user-agent UIs.
 Anti-phishing improvements to the user-agent UIs would still be needed,
 but one half of the problem is instantly addressed by using exclusive federatio
ns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This works for shopping as well.
 Thing of Amazon and Yahoo! Shopping as such shopping federations where
 the entity running the federation allows relatively few member services
 (orders of magnitude fewer than on the global Internet, in the TLS server
 PKI).
 In effect we already have this, but we have no strong way to bind this
 into the user authentication experience.
 If these federations provided a user authentication mechanism that provides
 mutual authentication and channel binding to TLS then the weaknesses of
 the TLS server PKI would become completely irrelevant to the federations,
 their members, and their users.
